family = [ "Aditya", "Poonam", "Noor", "Tulsi", "Archana", "Yuvraj", "Pooja"]

for family_members in family:
    print (f"This is {family_members}")

# For loops work by giving each element a type of name
# In the case above, each element is given the name "family_member"
# Then, the for loop specifies which list the elements are given that name
# Essentially, the loop is read like this: "In the list known as 'family', for each element (family_member), do the following:"

the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]



    '''

change = [ 1, "pennies", 2, "dimes", 3, "quarters" ]


for number in the_count:
    print (f"This is count {number}.")

for fruit in fruits:
