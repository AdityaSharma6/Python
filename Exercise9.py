days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun" # When creating variables, brackets are not required for strings.
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\Aug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec"

print (f"There are 7 days in a week: {days}")
print (f"There are 12 months in a year: {months}")

# If you want to type paragraphs or a large blurb that is neatly organized, use the following function
# """ ENTER TEXT HERE """

print (""" Here, I will demonstrate the mentioned function.
This function allows me to type as much as I want.
I can type an infinite amount of lines.
Each new line in the code will be treated as a new line once printed.
""")

# If you include spaces in the """ to make it look like " " ", then the
# program will not run. It is simply how the function was designed. You
# need to follow this pattern.
